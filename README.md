# Intro to React Tutorial 

## Description
This repositority will hold the artifacts that I create as I start to learn React. I'm going to kick off my study of React by starting with the React tutorial on the Reactjs website, which can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). I"m going to use this readme to keep track of my thoughts and things that stand out to me as I start on this journey.
